  I'm sure many of you are familiar with this picture from the Economist. It was used to describe the walled gardens, or data silos, as other people commonly refer to them.
  Even after all this time, it depicts our current reality with amazing accuracy! Most of you probably see people trying to escape by climbing these walls around common services like FB and LinkedIn. What you may have a hard time noticing is that there are no doors or even ladders in this picture. The data silos make to effort allow people to get out. This practice is called vendor lock-in.

  If you think big data is big, think again. With the IoT products hitting the market over the next few years, we will have to start talking about HUGE data. Everything we do, starting with the objects we touch, the ad panels we glance at, everything will be stored somewhere. Soon enough, software *alone* will decide whether you get a loan, a job, or maybe ultimately make life and death decisions. You may think that this is still early and/or it will never happen to you any time soon. Think again...

  Two years ago, there was a paper published in ... by two people: R.E and R.R., called ... Their experiments showed that a), b), c).
  We're fighting a war today that is far from being conventional. We've seen how public opinion can be easily influenced by abusing search engine results, or social networks. A single tweak in the search algorithm can make or break history. In the United States, half of the presidential elections have been won by margins under 7.6%, and the 2012 election was won by a margin of only 3.9%. That's well within the 20% margin.

  First, we need to aim for user-centricity. Right now, when a new service is launched, if we want to avoid using google or facebook to use it, then we need to sign up.

Sure, we might be able to download some of it, but then what? Where else can we use it?

What if, instead of having a business model that implies locking users into one specific service, companies focus more on the quality of their apps, the UI, UX and features. Imagine would great it would be to live in a world where companies compete based on cool features and UI/UX!
